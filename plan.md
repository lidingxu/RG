1. dash data set (import from sklearn? if not, how?): compare dash'model with LP and our model with GD

Large time limit

Same lambda (1e-4) 

1.a Our obj on training data set: (optimization)

1.b size of rules

1.c Loss on evaluation data set: (ML)



2. New large data set:

Only our model

2.a Our model with SGD: scalable


2.b Deal with continuous features: scalable + more accurate
